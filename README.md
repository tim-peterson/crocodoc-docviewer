===============

**docviewer-multidoc.js** is Crocodoc's docviewer.js modified to allow multiple documents per page.


DEMO

Rationale
----------------
Crocodoc's docviewer can't render multiple documents on the same page. This is because each page is given the ```id="Page{X}"``` where ```X``` is the page number. Therefore when multiple documents exist on the same page there are multiple elements with the same ```id```. This leads ```docviewer``` to ```append()``` each page's content to the **first** element having the matching ```id```. So, each page of the 2nd document get appended to the ```id```-matched pages of the 1st document. This means that 2nd document renders as a blank document and the 1st document has multiple documents' page content in each page.

The solution was to give each page an ```id``` that was specific to the document. I replaced all instances of:

	id="Page{X}"

 with: 

	id="Page{X}"-{docviewerObj.id}

where ```docviewerObj.id``` is the ```id=""``` that you gave to docviewer upon instantiating it. In order for the ```docviewerObj``` and thus ```docviewerObj.id```, to be globally available, I also had to add it as a parameter to ```docviewer```'s ```LazyLoader()``` function.
